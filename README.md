# mammography-ml
## Jupyter Notebook to create machine learning model &amp; explore mammography data to predict breast cancer using pandas
### 1. Read breast cancer data
### 2. Explore data : What kind of columns are there in the data, how does the data look like
### 3. Explore data : Run describe to figure out mean, count, median and other basic statistical functions
### 4. Explore data : Figure out if there are too many null values in the data, should we remove them or should we fill them?
### 5. Explore data : If data seems to be randomly distributed, drop the rows with null data
### 6. Features & Prediction : Figure out which columns are to be used for building the model and which one we need to predict
### 7. Pandas to Numpy arrays : Convert pandas data frame to numpy arrays
### 8. Pre-process data : Using sklearn, normalize the data
### 9. Split train-test data : Split data into training data set ( 75% ) and testing data set ( 25% ) using sklearn
### 10.Decision tree model: Use DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn to fit the model and find test and train score
